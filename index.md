## Course Description
Machine learning algorithms are often hard to give ironclad guarantees for since the data distribution is hard to model (e.g. images, language). In this course, we will attempt to get a handle on this by looking at a class of problems called inverse problems, where the data is generated by a well understood (but possibly noisy) forward process but with unknown parameters (e.g. an optical sensor measuring an unknown signal, sampling from a mixture of Gaussians with unknown means and covariances), and the goal is the "invert" the process to recover the true parameters. The theme of the course is to understand low dimensionality (from a bird's eye view) that underlies naturally occurring high dimensional data, and how it is used to obtain efficient robust algorithms for inverse problems. In the process, we hope to get insights that are broadly applicable to algorithms for machine learning.
