# CSS337.1 - Algorithms for Inverse Problems
**Spring 2025, STCS, TIFR**

Welcome to the official course page for **CSS337.1 - Algorithms for Inverse Problems**.

- **Instructor:** Jatin Batra 
- **Meeting Times:**  
  - Tuesdays and Fridays, 9:30 AM â€“ 11:00 AM  
- **Location:** Room A-238, STCS, TIFR  
- **First Lecture:** January 21, 2025 (Topic: *Compressed Sensing*)  

## Course Description
Inverse problems arise in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines, where the goal is to infer the internal structure of a system from external measurements. This course will focus on provably robust and efficient algorithms for a selected sample of such problems. The idea will be to build theory to exploit different kinds of *sparsity* in the high-dimensional signal.
